parallelBoxBlur
===============

In image processing, applying filter function is very common and [Box Blur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_blur) is one such method. In this repository I shared a C++ AMP implementation.

>Note:

>C++ AMP (C++ Accelerated Massive Parallelism) accelerates the execution of your C++ code by taking advantage of the data-parallel hardware that's commonly present as a graphics processing unit (GPU) on a discrete graphics card. The C++ AMP programming model includes support for multidimensional arrays, indexing, memory transfer, and tiling. It also includes a mathematical function library. You can use C++ AMP language extensions to control how data is moved from the CPU to the GPU and back.
